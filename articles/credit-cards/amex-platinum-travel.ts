## The Game-Changer: Milestone Benefits

The real value of this card comes from its milestone benefits. These are the highest in the Indian credit card market:

      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p class="mt-3 text-xs">• Total potential: 17,500 bonus points on ₹4L spend</p>
    <p class="text-xs">• Plus 8,000 base points = 25,500 points total (~₹12,750+ value)</p>
  </div>
</div>

### Crucial Detail: Bonus Points Require Phone Call

**Important:** Amex doesn't automatically credit bonus points. You must **call Amex customer service** and request these bonus points after hitting milestones. Many cardholders miss this, leaving thousands of points unclaimed!

**Tip:** Some users have successfully retrieved bonus points from prior years by calling and requesting them.

## Redemption Options & Value

### Taj Voucher Redemptions

- **Value:** 1 MR point = ₹1 Taj Voucher (1% return)
- **Options:** Taj properties across India
- **Booking:** Direct on Taj website with voucher code
- **Note:** Some properties are overpriced on Taj website

### Marriott Bonvoy Transfers

- **Transfer Ratio:** 1 MR point = 0.30-0.33 Marriott points
- **Transfer Bonus:** Limited-time bonuses (10K points bonus on 60K transfer)
- **Value:** Can reach 1.5-2% depending on transfer ratio
- **Note:** Only available on Amex and MRCC card points, not pooled

### Direct Cash Redemptions

- **Cashback:** 1 MR point = ₹0.50 (0.5% return) - not recommended
- **Amazon Vouchers:** Available at poor value (0.25ps/point)

## The Verdict

<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-pink-500 to-rose-500 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6 dark:from-pink-700 dark:to-rose-700">
  <div class="text-white">
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">CardExpert Rating: 5/5</h3>
    <p class="text-sm">The Amex Platinum Travel Credit Card with ~8.5% reward rate is one of the highest rewarding travel cards in India and is an absolute must-have for anyone who loves travel benefits.</p>
  </div>
</div>

**The Verdict:** This card is a no-brainer if you spend ₹4L+ annually on travel. The milestone benefits are unmatched in India, and the card essentially becomes free after Year 1. The only drawback is Amex's limited acceptance, but for booking flights and hotels (where the real rewards are), acceptance is generally good. For serious travelers, this is non-negotiable.

3. **Taj Vouchers:** Excellent for exploring Taj properties nationwide
4. **Marriott Transfers:** Enables international hotel redemptions
5. **Fee Justification:** Essentially free from Year 2 onwards
